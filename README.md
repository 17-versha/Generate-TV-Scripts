<p><h2><strong>TV Script Generation:</h2></strong><h3><em> Train a recurrent neural network to generate scripts in the style of dialogue from Seinfeld.</em></h3></p>
<p>In this project, I have generate my own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. I have used Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network that I have built will generate a new, "fake" TV script.<p>
